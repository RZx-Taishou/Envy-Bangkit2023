## About
ENVy (Environments Quality) is a mobile application designed to detect and measure the quality of water, air, and soil based on predetermined chemical parameters. ENVy provides detailed reports on environmental quality based on the specified parameters, enabling users to make informed decisions and take appropriate actions. This application empowers users to become agents of change who care about the environment.

## Background
Research shows that poor environmental quality can have a negative impact on both human health and the environment. However, information about environmental quality is often difficult to obtain and hard for the general public to understand. Therefore, our team aims to solve this problem by creating a mobile application that can predict environmental quality based on chemical parameters. This application will allow users to obtain accurate and up-to-date information about environmental quality in their surroundings and help them take appropriate preventive measures. We also want to assist the government in making decisions regarding environmental policies by providing data that has been collected

## Project Goals
- The goal is to simplify the complex information related to environmental quality, making it easier for the general public to comprehend
- Enable the general public to make informed decisions regarding their environment. By providing accessible and understandable information,
the application should empower users to take appropriate actions to
protect their health and the environment.
- Assist the government in making informed decisions about environmental
policies. By providing reliable and comprehensive data on environmental
quality, the application can contribute to evidence-based decision-making
and help shape effective environmental regulations.

## Features
  - [Soil Predict Quality](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1ePbPR4LnEpe2FCwHuwFDZhwKMnxiz2Fw?usp=drive_link): Predict soil quality with Nitrogen,Phosphorus, Potassium, pH parameters (accuracy 94.03% and validation accuracy 91.14%)
  - [Water Predict Quality](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/19MmQ6BhpWw09TwLgfmosaj2tB80bjAg1?usp=drive_link) : Predict water quality with FC, Oxygen, pH,Total Suspended Sediment, Temperature, Nitrogen,Phosphorus,Turbidity parameters (accuracy 87.77% and validation accuracy 81.48%)
  - [Air Predict Quality](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/17gD6_P7ClBwBsklMLaXzZ-QMBHeKwxyG?usp=drive_link)   : Predict air quality with Nitrogen     Dioxide,Ozone, Carbon Monoxide, Particulate Matter parameters (accuracy 98% and validation accuracy 98%)
